# RPG-Manager
## Idea

Given that DND-Beyond has become a staple for many DND-Tables and other Games can not afford to offer such services I started this project.
The End goal is being able to host a game with different turntracker, dice, characters(which themselves have different abilities and stats). 

This should be the core, while other project(s) will cover the front end bits.

Way early, so can't offer any installation advice!
